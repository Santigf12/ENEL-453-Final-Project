\section{AI Use}

The AI tools in the project used were Claude and ChatGPT.

For the design portion of the RTL code and the circuit AI was used in help with debugging, clarifying questions, 
and creating some structure of the modules not provided. All code generated was tested, fixed and verified it functionality before committing to it.

Although, it was really useful to explain and clarifying topics, in terms of implementations of RTL code it was more lackluster, requiring reviewing
each code line manually making sure its functionality.

Furthermore, in terms of writing it was used for outline and explanations, as well as, fixing grammar, all writing was creating by hard and verified.
