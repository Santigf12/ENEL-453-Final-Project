\section{System architecture}

Our system is based on the required hierarchical organization common and mostly necessary in FPGA design.

We divided our Top Module into multiple submodules which are the XADC, PWM, R2R subsystems each of these encompass the 
required components, combinational logic, and connections, that make these subsystems work. Furthermore, we have the 7-segment display modules,
as well as, the MUX4 and DP MUX, which let the user select between the different outputs each of the subsystems print in the display, see \autoref{fig:rtl-schematic}.

The circuit design is divided into the PWM comparator circuit and the R2R ladder circuit which its main requirement is to compare the data signals coming
from the Basys3 board that get displayed into values displayed based on the changes of the voltage due to the potentiometer see \autoref{fig:proto-photos}.

The design allows the user to select into the following different outputs values.
