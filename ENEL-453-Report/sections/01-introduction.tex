\section{Introduction}

The goal of the design project was to test all the FPGA design topics seen in class, such as, Analog-to-Digital converters (ADCs), PWM systems,
as well, as R2R circuits with hierarchical design in mind using the Digilent Basys3 FPGA board.

\subsection{Objectives}

The main objectives of the final project which entail around a 95\% tier in the project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a menu and display system to change the values printed in the 7-segment display in the board.
  \item Reference the XADC subsystem that displays average and scaled values.
  \item Use a discrete PWM ramp and R2R ADC subsystem.
  \item Design and create a Successive Approximation Algorithm (SAR) for both the PWM and R2R circuits as an FSM.
  \item Final RTL design with a max to clock frequency of 200 MHZ while meeting timing.
\end{itemize}
