\section{Conclusion}

In summary, our team was able to complete the final project design up to the 100\% eligible bracket by finishing
all the required modules of R2R ladder and PWM including the SAR algorithm, with the correct output values in the R2R and PWM ramp modes, as well as, 
correct comparisons using the SAR algorithm. Furthermore, our design optimization and efficiency was able to allow higher than normal speeds with still a 
positive WNS.
