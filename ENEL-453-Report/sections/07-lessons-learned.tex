\section{Lessons learned}

The main things to take about this project is the importance of the hierarchical design, that used in different coding practices, is fundamental for HDLs.

Our approach of starting the RTL design from the top module down into other modules was the correct design since it made the code more organized,
easier to debug, and maintain.

In the other hand, something to think retrospectively is our incorrect approach in testing by utilizing actual proper industry practices by using test benches and other tools,
our development times, errors and mistakes could have been mitigated.
